    "text": "This interactive dashboard shows the legacy of residential segregation, one that has led to stark environmental injustice that tremendously ails Black, Latino, and Native American families in Minneapolis.\nThe correlation between climate change effects and marginalized neighborhoods are apparent: the more socially vulnerable a neighborhood is, the more exposed they are to the effects of climate change—and we can trace this back to residential seggregation practices from the early 20th century. [add svi ~ holc model info + interpretation here?]\n\n\n\n\n\nRacial Covenants and Land Surface Temperature\n\n\n\nThe map shown on the right are racial covenants and mean land surface temperature map per census tract. As you can see that are with higher mean LST are in places with lower HOLC Grade and little to no racial covenants areas. Similarly, areas with higher HOLC Grade and with many racial covenants areas experience lower mean LST.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRacial Covenants and Social Vulnerability\n\n\n\nNow the map shown on the right are racial covenants compared with air pollution map. Similarly to LST, you can see areas with higher annual PM2.5 are areas with low HOLC Grade, such as C and D, and places with little to no racial covenants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRacial Covenants and Air Pollution\n\n\n\nNow the map shown on the right are racial covenants compared with social vulnerability map. You can see that places with higher social vulnerability index score are places with low HOLC Grade and places with little to no racial covenant areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, environmental injustices are deeply tied to historical segregation practices. To further study these patterns, we analyzed key numerical results:\n\n\n\n\nLand Surface Temperature (LST):\n\n\n\n\n\nOn average, census tracts with higher social vulnerability had mean land surface temperatures that were 2.22°F higher than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy coverage.\nThe median of mean land surface temperature for socially vulnerable group is 95.78, and The median of mean land surface temperature for socially not vulnerable group is 93.78.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnual Air Pollution:\n\nOn average, census tracts with higher social vulnerability had annual air pollution 0.97 tons than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy coverage.\nThe median of annual air pollution for socially vulnerable group is 1.597467 tons, and The median of mean land surface temperature for socially not vulnerable group is 1.013138 tons."

In other words, how much does the introduction of racial covenants in the 1910s impact the environmental inequality in Minneapolis that we see today? How can we, then, inform environmental practices with data?"
