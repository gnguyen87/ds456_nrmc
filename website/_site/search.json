And there has been extensive research around environmental injustice, yet they tend to merely provide a snapshot of this picture at a moment in time. How can we contextualize and provide a comprehensive portrayal of this injustice?"

In other words, how much does the introduction of racial covenants in the 1910s impact the environmental inequality in Minneapolis that we see today? How can we, then, inform environmental practices with data?"

    "text": "This interactive dashboard allows you to explore the legacy of residential segregation, one that has led to stark environmental injustice that tremendously ails Black, Latino, and Native American families in Minneapolis.\nThe correlation between climate change effects and marginalized neighborhoods are apparent: the more socially vulnerable a neighborhood is, the more exposed they are to the effects of climate change—and we can trace this back to residential seggregation practices from the early 20th century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial Vulnerability vs. Climate Change\nFrom our findings, it was clear that socially vulnerable neighborhoods (high poverty levels and minority population) are more exposed to air pollution and higher temperatures.\nWe observed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability are exposed to 0.96 tons of PM2.5 more than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy, HOLC grade and racial covenants. In the same vein, our model revealed that census tracts with higher social vulnerability had a mean land surface temperature that were 2.22°F higher than less vulnerable areas, even when controlling for tree canopy, HOLC grade and racial covenants.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA Closer Look\nLet’s take a closer look at how residential seggregation correlates with the disparity in air pollution, and temperature in different Minneapolis neighborhoods.\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we will look at the uneven distribution of land surface temperature in Minneapolis as a result of racial covenants and redlining.\n\n\n\n\nIn higher HOLC grade neighborhoods with dense concentrations of racial covenants, today’s land surface temperature is markedly lower.\n\n\n\n\nContrastly, land surface temperature is remarkably higher in areas that were deemed as “declining”, “hazardous”, and “undesirable”–areas where there were little to no racial covenants.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, we can observe these patterns when comparing levels of air pollution from factories.\n\n\n\n\nNeighborhoods with a lot of previous racial covenants, ones that were deemed as desirable and worthy of investment, tend to have no factories planted within its vacinity. In other words, they tend to be exposed to zero emissions of PM2.5 from nearyby factories.\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, in the Near North neighborhood (no racial covenants and C-D HOLC grade), one of Minneapolis’ communities with the biggest BIPOC population, are exposed to severely high levels of PM2.5 emissions. This is because within their area, there are around 15 air emitting factories–including the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center."
