    "text": "This interactive dashboard shows the legacy of residential segregation, one that has led to stark environmental injustice that tremendously ails Black, Latino, and Native American families in Minneapolis.\nThe correlation between climate change effects and marginalized neighborhoods are apparent: the more socially vulnerable a neighborhood is, the more exposed they are to the effects of climate change—and we can trace this back to residential seggregation practices from the early 20th century.\nThe Social Vulnerability Index is an index score released by the CDC that utilizes a variety of survey variables to highlight communities’ social vulnerability, which is defined as “certain social conditions, including high poverty, low percentage of vehicle access, or crowded households, among others, may affect that community’s ability to prevent human suffering and financial loss in the event of a disaster.” [cite SVI documentation] A linear model of the impact of historical redlining grades on the SVI score of Minneapolis census tracts shows the following predicted SVI results, with significant p-values (SVI scores are in a percentile range from 0 to 1, with 1 the most vulnerable:\n\nA (“Best”): 0.25683\nB (“Still Desirable”): 0.48408\nC (“Definitely Declining”): 0.84779\nD (“Hazardous”): 0.73834\n\nNeighborhoods given grades of C and D - almost always neighborhoods mostly populated by people of color - clearly still face the adverse consequences of redlining and similar practices in the form of increased vulnerability to climate disasters and other soicioeconomic issues today."

    "text": "Urban areas in the United States are growing to now accommodate about 83% of the population (1). As cities grow to accommodate the needs of their populations, it becomes increasingly essential to consider how cities are prioritizing green spaces and urban trees. Along with the ecological benefits, urban green spaces have been shown to improve mental health, physical health, and generate a sense of community for the surrounding residents (2). The following map and statistical analysis show that there is a need to make urban green space more accessible for disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs demonstrated above, access to park areas varies across Minneapolis census tracts, with some tracts lacking parks entirely and others having an abundance. In order to test whether or not parks are equally available across census tracts in Minneapolis, we performed a linear regression analyzing the relationship between total park area (\\(m^2\\)) and HOLC grade. This data came from [cite HOLC].\nlm(formula = total_park_area ~ holc_grade)\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nStd. Error\nt-value\nP-value\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n960894\n207396\n4.633\n9.79e-06 ***\n\n\nholc_grade_B\n-189583\n236679\n-0.801\n0.42482\n\n\nholc_grade_C\n-817086\n242877\n-3.364\n0.00105 **\n\n\nholc_grade_D\n-736108\n255695\n-2.879\n0.00478 **\n\n\n\n\n\nThe linear regression model uses the park areas in census tracts of HOLC grade A as a baseline to compare to census tracts of HOLC grades B, C, and D. The results from this model show that there is no significant difference in total park area between census tracts of HOLC grades A and B since the P-value is insignificant. However, the model shows a significant decline in total park area in both census tracts of HOLC grades C and D in comparison to HOLC grade A census tracts. HOLC grade C census tracts are expected to have 817086 \\(m^2\\) less park area than HOLC grade A census tracts, and HOLC grade D census tracts are expected to have 736108 \\(m^2\\) less park area than HOLC grade A census tracts. While this model analyzes the park area across census tracts, our site visit exploration also showed that the parks in HOLC grade A neighborhoods were much more developed and attended than the parks in HOLC grade C and D neighborhoods. This prompts future investment into already existing parks in HOLC grade C and D neighborhoods.\n\n\nAdd introductory sentence Below, we use a linear model to analyze the relationship between park space and social vulnerability in Minneapolis census tracts.\nlm(formula = SVI ~ total_park_area)\n\n\n\nVariable\nEstimate\nStd. Error\nt-value\nP-value\n\n\n\n\nIntercept\n0.674195\n0.046930\n14.366\n&lt;210^-16 **\n\n\npark_percentage\n-0.009326\n0.003583\n-2.603\n0.0107\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model shows us that for every additional 1% of a census tract area covered by parks, its social vulnerability score (measured on a 0 to 1 percentile scale) drops by an average of 0.009. That is, if one tract has 10% more green space than another, we can expect it to score 9 percentile points better on SVI, indicating a strong relationship between a community’s access to public green spaces and its overall wellbeing."

In other words, how much does the introduction of racial covenants in the 1910s impact the environmental inequality in Minneapolis that we see today? How can we, then, inform environmental practices with data?"
