you need the Minneapolis_City_Cleaned.tif raster file and it is in your slack inbox. msp_sf is the surface temperature data.

```{r}
msp_tif <- rast("~/Documents/School/Capstone/project files copy/data/Minneapolis_City_Cleaned.tif")

msp_poly <-  as.polygons(msp_tif, dissolve = TRUE)

msp_sf <- st_as_sf(msp_poly)

msp_sf
```
